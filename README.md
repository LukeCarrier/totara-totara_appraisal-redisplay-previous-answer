Totara appraisals - enhanced "redisplay previous answer"
========================================================

Totara's new appraisals functionality provides a "Redisplay Previous Answer"
question type (```datatype```). This feature is useful, but lacks the
following nifty abilities:

* Displaying content from other roles. It's only possible to show the
  current role's answers.
* Displaying content to roles unable to view the original (redisplayed)
  question. All redisplayed questions share their permissions with the
  original.

For developer use only
----------------------

Totara Learning Solutions have yet to release any developer documentation
for this feature whatsoever. As a result, all of my assumptions about how
the system works are likely wrong and this code is very likely to break
things in strange and mysterious ways.

Don't apply it in production.
